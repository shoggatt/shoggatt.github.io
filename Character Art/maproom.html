      <p class="paragraph_style">An animated portrait of a fox character in a room 
        full of maps and treasure.<br>
        <br>
        I drew and animated this piece in Clip Studio Paint. The motion of the fox's 
        body is tweened, and the motion of their eyes and the flickering candles 
        is frame-by-frame.<br>
        <br>
        In this piece, I wanted to try making an immersive background with many 
        elements besides the fox character. I also wanted to make the colors 
        coehsive so that the background did not distract from the character.
