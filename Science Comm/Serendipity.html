    <div class="explainbox"><p class="paragraph_style"><em>Serendipity</em> is an episode of a documentary called 
      <em>Curiosity: The Making of a Scientist</em> made by the STAGE lab at the University of Chicago.
        The goal of <em>Curiosity</em> is to make research more understandable and accessible to nonscientific audiences 
        by showing the personal lives of researchers and explaining how and why they chose science as a career.<br>
        <br>
        My role in <em>Serendipity</em> involved making animations to visually explain the science of a cancer researcher 
        who uses a technique called crystallography to study the structure of proteins in immune cells.

      <p>I worked closely with Sunanda Prabhu-Gaunkar and Nicole Zhong to make these animations. </p>
