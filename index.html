       <p class="paragraph_style">Hi, I'm Sara! I am a bioengineer, a digital artist, and a composer of electronic music.<br>
        <br>
        As a bioengineer, I study how to help immune cells better fight off diseases like bacterial infections and cancer.
        One of the primary tools I use to study immune cells is microscopy. Microscopy is a great tool for research 
        as well as science communication because it makes cells visible. I aim to continue using microscopy to 
        make art about my research to make it understandable to nonscientific audiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a digital artist, I enjoy drawing and designing characters, especially in fantasy and science 
        fiction settings.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a composer of electronic music, I enjoy combining field recordings and homemade synth sounds.
